Key Features: All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game.

Sure, if that\\\\u2019s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN.

Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he\\'s stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.) 87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot! Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever!  From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you\\\\u2019ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn! Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2.

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\\\\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies\\' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can\\\\u2019t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper\\'s nest. You are the enemy\\'s constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire\\'s strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.

While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.

Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever \\\\u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications \\\\u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way \\\\u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing.

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes.

Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \\\\\"tug of war\\\\\". Ambush --- A high value target (\\\\\"HVT\\\\\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\\'s one team\\'s goal to make this happen and it\\'s the other team\\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\\'s goal is to take the enemy\\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum,OS:,Windows\\\\u00ae 7,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom\\\\u2122 X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel\\\\u00ae or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.98\"}, {\"_id\": 225540, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/225540/Just_Cause_3/\", \"name\": \"Just Cause\\\\u2122 3\", \"descSnippet\": \"With over 1000 km\\\\u00b2 of complete freedom from sky to seabed, Rico Rodriguez returns to unleash chaos in the most creative and explosive ways imaginable.\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 359, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 76, \"allReviewsCount\": 37858, \"allReviewsPercent\": 73, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1448809200000}, \"developer\": \"Avalanche Studios\", \"publisher\": \"Square Enix,Square Enix\", \"popularTags\": \"Open World,Action,Destruction,Third-Person Shooter,Adventure,Singleplayer,Shooter,Multiplayer,Third Person,Sandbox,Exploration,Physics,Funny,Atmospheric,Comedy,Parkour,Great Soundtrack,Co-op,Moddable,RPG\", \"gameDetails\": \"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards\", \"languages\": \"English,French,Italian,German,Spanish - Spain,Arabic,Polish,Portuguese - Brazil,Russian,Japanese\", \"achievements\": \"66.0\", \"genre\": \"Action,Adventure\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game  The Mediterranean republic of Medici is suffering under the brutal control of General Di Ravello, a dictator with an insatiable appetite for power.

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\\\\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\\\\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \\\\\"Engrams\\\\\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you\\'ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \\\\\"Explorer Notes\\\\\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\\\\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK\\'s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique \\'Procedurally Generated ARKs\\', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

INTRODUCTION Overview Battle gigantic monsters in epic locales. As a hunter, you\\'ll take on quests to hunt monsters in a variety of habitats. Take down these monsters and receive materials that you can use to create stronger weapons and armor in order to hunt even more dangerous monsters. In Monster Hunter: World, the latest installment in the series, you can enjoy the ultimate hunting experience, using everything at your disposal to hunt monsters in a new world teeming with surprises and excitement. Setting Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing. To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined. ECOSYSTEM A World That Breathes Life There are various locations teeming with wildlife. Expeditions into these locales are bound to turn up interesting discoveries. HUNTING A Diverse Arsenal, and an Indispensable Partner Your equipment will give you the power to need to carve out a place for yourself in the New World. The Hunter\\'s Arsenal There are fourteen different weapons at the hunter\\'s disposal, each with its own unique characteristics and attacks. Many hunters acquire proficiency in multiple types, while others prefer to attain mastery of one. Scoutflies Monster tracks, such as footprints and gashes, dot each locale. Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information. Slinger The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale. From diversion tactics to creating shortcuts, the Slinger has a variety of uses, and allows you to hunt in new and interesting ways. Specialized Tools Specialized tools activate powerful effects for a limited amount of time, and up to two can be equipped at a time. Simple to use, they can be selected and activated just like any other item you take out on a hunt. Palicoes Palicoes are hunters\\' reliable comrades out in the field, specialized in a variety of offensive, defensive, and restorative support abilities. The hunter\\'s Palico joins the Fifth Fleet with pride, as much a bona fide member of the Commission as any other hunter. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,WINDOWS\\\\u00ae 7, 8, 8.1, 10 (64-bit required),Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 i5-4460, 3.20GHz or AMD FX\\\\u2122-6300,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA\\\\u00ae GeForce\\\\u00ae GTX 760 or AMD Radeon\\\\u2122 R7 260x (VRAM 2GB),DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,30 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectSound (DirectX\\\\u00ae 9.0c),Additional Notes:,1080p/30fps when graphics settings are set to \\\\\"Low\\\\\"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,WINDOWS\\\\u00ae 7, 8, 8.1, 10 (64-bit required),Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 i7 3770 3.4GHz or Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 i3 8350 4GHz or AMD Ryzen\\\\u2122 5 1500X,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA\\\\u00ae GeForce\\\\u00ae GTX 1060 (VRAM 3GB) or AMD Radeon\\\\u2122 RX 570  (VRAM 4GB),DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,30 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectSound (DirectX\\\\u00ae 9.0c or better),Additional Notes:,1080p/30fps when graphics settings are set to \\\\\"High\\\\\"\", \"originalPrice\": \"$59.99\"}, {\"_id\": 755790, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/755790/Ring_of_Elysium/\", \"name\": \"Ring of Elysium\", \"descSnippet\": \"Escape an astonishing disaster in Ring of Elysium, a battle royale shooter developed by Aurora Studio.\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 1488, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 61, \"allReviewsCount\": 54938, \"allReviewsPercent\": 74, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1537282800000}, \"developer\": \"Aurora Studio\", \"publisher\": \"TCH Scarlet Limited,TCH Scarlet Limited\", \"popularTags\": \"Early Access,Free to Play,Battle Royale,Shooter,Multiplayer,Survival,Early Access,Action,Massively Multiplayer,FPS,Third-Person Shooter,Open World,PvP,Co-op,First-Person,Tactical,Violent,Sandbox,Gore,Destruction\", \"gameDetails\": \"Online Multi-Player\", \"languages\": \"English,Simplified Chinese\", \"achievements\": \"\", \"genre\": \"Action,Free to Play,Massively Multiplayer,Early Access\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game  \", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  Includes intense violence and blood.  \", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10,Processor:,Intel i3 8130U(2Cores, 2.3GHz) or equivalent,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 or equivalent,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX-compatible using the latest drivers\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit version),Processor:,Intel i5 2500(4 Core, 3.3HGz) or equivalent,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or equivalent,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX-compatible using the latest drivers\", \"originalPrice\": \"Free To Play\"}]Action : [{\"_id\": 10, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike/\", \"name\": \"Counter-Strike\", \"descSnippet\": \"Play the world\\'s number 1 online action game.

NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player\\'s presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source\\\\u00ae, Valve\\'s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \\\\\"muscles,\\\\\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.  Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.  Graphics: Source\\'s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story\\\\u00ae and Monster\\'s, Inc.\\\\u00ae, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.  AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.  \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"\", \"originalPrice\": \"$9.99\"}, {\"_id\": 240, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/\", \"name\": \"Counter-Strike: Source\", \"descSnippet\": \"Just updated to include player stats, achievements, new scoreboards and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 439, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 94, \"allReviewsCount\": 45829, \"allReviewsPercent\": 95, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1099234800000}, \"developer\": \"Valve\", \"publisher\": \"Valve,Valve\", \"popularTags\": \"Shooter,Action,FPS,Multiplayer,Team-Based,First-Person,Tactical,Competitive,PvP,e-sports,Military,War,Strategy,Moddable,Difficult,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Survival,Simulation,Sandbox\", \"gameDetails\": \"Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Includes Source SDK\", \"languages\": \"English,French,German,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Russian,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese,Thai,Turkish\", \"achievements\": \"147.0\", \"genre\": \"Action\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE WORLD\\'S # 1 ONLINE ACTION GAME Counter-Strike: Source blends Counter-Strike\\'s award-winning teamplay action with the advanced technology of Source\\\\u2122 technology.

With a good ship and the right crew, you can conquer the skies! A vivid steampunk world  Lumbering, heavily-armored airships bristling with guns patrol the skies above a land ravaged beyond repair by an out-of-control industrial revolution. Build your own airship  Starting from a selection of basic hulls, players can mix and match hundreds of custom parts to create their own unique airship, then assemble a crew to fly it. Your ship is your life  Your ship is your collective life bar - when the ship goes down, the crew goes down with it. Every member of the crew plays an integral role in not only maintaining the integrity - \\\\u201clife\\\\u201d - of the ship, but also weakening the integrity of enemy ships as they work cooperatively towards a shared victory. The ultimate multiplayer team experience  You won\\\\u2019t be told to stay still and not die while a veteran preserves their Kill/Death ratio. In Guns of Icarus Online, you have to work together.

The Industrial Revolution never ended. Raging out of control, the new machines consumed the world, staining the sky, scouring the land and poisoning the water. Humanity came the brink of extinction, all but destroyed by their own unrestrained ingenuity. A few pockets of civilization survived, sheltering in the crevices of the world, and it is time for a comeback. Divided by wide expanses of toxic wasteland, a handful of these remnants have developed airship technology. Cruising through the sky, safely away from the poisoned earth, trade and industry could finally begin anew. However, with resources so desperately limited, war was inevitable. We are Muse Games, an independent studio based out of New York City. Our debut game, Flight of the Icarus , was the seed that would later grow into our flagship title. After releasing the unique and eye-catching platform game CreaVures in 2011, we dedicated ourselves to re-engineering our debut title into a fully-featured cooperative online airship combat game. We released Guns of Icarus Online in October 2012, right in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the Guns of Icarus experience. What was originally intended to be an expansion that would introduce AI opponents and player-vs-environment gameplay grew into a new standalone game - Guns of Icarus Alliance , the ultimate and definitive Guns of Icarus experience - which released in March 2017. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"\", \"originalPrice\": \"$4.99\"}, {\"_id\": 210770, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/210770/Sanctum_2/\", \"name\": \"Sanctum 2\", \"descSnippet\": \"Sanctum 2 is the sequel to the world\\\\u2019s first Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game.

The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid \\\\u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET \\\\u2013 The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician \\\\\"The Elephant\\\\\", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level \\\\u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios \\\\u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills \\\\u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever \\\\u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications \\\\u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way \\\\u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly. New Game Content All the Time \\\\u2013 More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.

The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called \\\\u201cThe Order\\\\u201d, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values. The combination of Ninja Theory\\\\u2019s expertise and Capcom\\\\u2019s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new level of cinematic quality to the title. Key Features Survive Limbo - The world of Limbo is a living and breathing entity, out to kill Dante. The world will transform in real-time and try to block off and even kill our hero. Our protagonist will have to master demonic powers to shape Limbo the way he sees fit, while perfecting his angelic skills to traverse this hazardous, twisted world. Who is Dante? \\\\u2013 Explore a retelling of Dante\\\\u2019s origin story in a gripping narrative featuring familiar faces from the series alongside all new characters, including Vergil, Dante\\\\u2019s twin brother. Unbridled action \\\\u2013 The intense and iconic sword and gun based combat returns with the addition of new Angel and Demon weapons and abilities, all designed to dispatch the demonic spawn back to hell with style and panache. Weapons include: \\\\u201cRebellion\\\\u201d : Dante\\\\u2019s trusted sword, given by his father Sparda, provides a great mix of combos and attacks, great for sending enemies skyward. \\\\u201cEbony & Ivory\\\\u201d : These guns are good for keeping enemies at bay, maintaining combos and juggling enemies in the air. \\\\u201cArbiter\\\\u201d : a demonic axe that can deliver massive blows and break through enemy shields. \\\\u201cOsiris\\\\u201d : an angelic scythe with fast attacks and great for crowd control. \\\\u201cEryx\\\\u201d : powerful demonic gauntlets that pack enough punch to parry even the strongest attacks and juggle the heaviest enemies. Retaining the Devil May Cry DNA \\\\u2013 Capcom staff, including team members from previous Devil May Cry titles, have been assigned to the project from the outset to ensure DmC is a true addition to the Devil May Cry franchise. Unrivalled production values - Ninja Theory will take advantage of the latest performance capture technology to deliver a level of character design, story-telling and cinematics that perfectly complements DmC\\\\u2019s high-octane combat. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows Vista(R)/XP, Windows 7, Windows 8,Processor:,Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo 2.4 Ghz or better, AMD Athlon(TM) X2 2.8 Ghz or better,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) 8800GTS or better, ATI Radeon(TM) HD 3850 or better,DirectX\\\\u00ae:,9.0c,Hard Drive:,9 GB HD space,Sound:,Standard audio device\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows Vista(R)/XP, Windows 7, Windows 8,Processor:,Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad 2.7 Ghz or better, AMD Phenom(TM)II X4 3 Ghz or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon(TM) HD 6950 or better,DirectX\\\\u00ae:,9.0c,Hard Drive:,9 GB HD space,Sound:,Standard audio device\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.99\"}, {\"_id\": 221380, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/Age_of_Empires_II_HD/\", \"name\": \"Age of Empires II HD\", \"descSnippet\": \"Age of Empires II has been re-imagined in high definition with new features, trading cards, improved AI, workshop support, multiplayer, Steamworks integration and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 533, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 93, \"allReviewsCount\": 46206, \"allReviewsPercent\": 94, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1365433200000}, \"developer\": \"Skybox Labs,Hidden Path Entertainment,Ensemble Studios,Forgotten Empires\", \"publisher\": \"Xbox Game Studios,Xbox Game Studios\", \"popularTags\": \"Strategy,RTS,Medieval,Multiplayer,Classic,Historical,Base Building,City Builder,Resource Management,Singleplayer,Tactical,Real-Time,Co-op,Competitive,Masterpiece,Replay Value,Remake,2D,Action,Isometric\", \"gameDetails\": \"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Captions available,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Includes level editor\", \"languages\": \"English,German,French,Italian,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Simplified Chinese,Russian,Japanese,Dutch,Portuguese - Brazil\", \"achievements\": \"294.0\", \"genre\": \"Strategy\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game In Age of Empires II: HD Edition, fans of the original game and new players alike will fall in love with the classic Age of Empires II experience.

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \\\\\"tug of war\\\\\". Ambush --- A high value target (\\\\\"HVT\\\\\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\\'s one team\\'s goal to make this happen and it\\'s the other team\\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\\'s goal is to take the enemy\\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum,OS:,Windows\\\\u00ae 7,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom\\\\u2122 X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel\\\\u00ae or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.98\"}, {\"_id\": 223470, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/POSTAL_2/\", \"name\": \"POSTAL 2\", \"descSnippet\": \"Live a week in the life of \\\\\"The Postal Dude\\\\\"; a hapless everyman just trying to check off some chores.

It includes a completely original cast, with a carefully crafted script to bring the Estranged world to life. Amazing Graphics - Estranged is built on the same engine Half-Life 2 runs, with some additional features. We have extended the dynamic lighting system to allow us to illuminate our levels in a realistic manner, and have included effects such as film grain and lens flare to help create the atmosphere for the game. Original Soundtrack - The soundtrack was written especially for Estranged, and was designed alongside the game\\'s levels. The music matches gameplay, and helps to bring together the atmosphere in Estranged to bring the story to life. Please note: This game uses some assets from Half-Life: 2.

A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you! Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica\\'s oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior. The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism. Environments and vehicles in BeamNG. drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving. We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG. drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be. Why is BeamNG. drive the game for you? As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG. drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in. In some ways, BeamNG. drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don\\'t let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG. drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn\\'t force you to do anything that you don\\'t think is fun or interesting. The future of the game and our physics engine As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor. We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim. Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane\\'s airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge. Alpha Access Features  All future updates to BeamNG. drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game  Soft-body physics sandbox  19 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come  10 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come  Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes  Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay  Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software  Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run. Alpha Testers Users that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key. Our goals Our main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system. Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL. Our mission To have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.

It\\\\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \\\\u201crandom\\\\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers \\\\u2013 they\\\\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\\\\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person\\\\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \\\\u2013 but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they\\'ll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You\\'re not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they\\'re too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters\\' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer\\'s leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino\\'s horn, and it\\'s much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he\\'ll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there\\'s much more than that!

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meagre supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls \\\\\"the pinnacle of an entire genre\\\\\". The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes two of the five episodes that form its Season One. Both episodes were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - \\\\u201cDo Not Go Gentle\\\\u201d Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - \\\\u201cLuminance Fugue\\\\u201d Mackenzie\\\\u2019s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? The first two episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 15 hours of gameplay. Episodes Three to Five are included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION & CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. SCOUR THE WORLD FOR SUPPLIES Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. A VAST LIVING WORLD Explore a 50 square kilometre Northern Canadian wilderness in search of precious supplies. In Winter. Dynamic time of day, weather, wildlife presence, etc. provide just enough randomness to keep things challenging. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Five Challenges exist at launch, with more on the way in future updates. In addition to releasing the remaining three episodes of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode, as we have done with about 100 updates/hotfixes over the past three years of Early Access. Keep in mind that your purchase of The Long Dark entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE, as well as updates to Survival Mode along the way.

If only Kaho could somehow gain audience with the Queen, Her Majesty could surely be convinced to lend her power to help save the land and its inhabitants from certain doom\\\\u2015but time is short, and each coming night falls darker than the last... Reverie Under The Moonlight is the fourth installment in the Momodora series of side-scrolling action platformers, featuring melee combos, dodge mechanics, and a plethora of items and spells to unleash upon your enemies. Play casually to fully take in and enjoy the rich setting and engaging, mysterious story, or crank up the difficulty to run your reflexes through a truly brutal gauntlet. Beautifully animated graphics Exciting action gameplay: pull off impressive combos, dodge attacks, and skewer enemies with arrows Intense boss battles with challenging patterns and epic scale Difficulty settings appropriate for all types of players\\\\u2015from story and setting lovers to hardcore action enthusiasts A breadth of items that can be combined to facilitate new strategies An amazingly diverse world to explore, filled with secrets and treasures Eccentric allies and foes with compelling personalities Mysterious lore and rich backstory woven into events, dialogue, and item descriptions For this fourth installment in the Momodora series\\\\u2015which actually serves a prequel to the previous games\\\\u2015the primary focus during development was on improvements to the gameplay and art. The combat gameplay has truly evolved since the days of Momo III, and the character sprites are now bigger and better animated. We also made an effort to include more tiny details here and there, expand on the world lore, and create more exciting boss battles. I believe this is the best Momodora game in the series, and definitely the most polished title so far. Most of us at Playism grew up playing video games during the early days of the NES, and throughout the years, action-platformers have been some of the staples in our respective game libraries. Long before \\\\u201cMetroidvania\\\\u201d was a thing, we fell in love with the original Castlevania series, as well as with other Hall of Famers such as the Metroid, Contra, and Ninja Gaiden games. About halfway through the lifecycle of the first-generation PlayStation, sprite-based game development took an unfortunate nosedive, and the sorts of games we loved most and grew up with just weren\\'t being made as frequently or, frankly, with as much love and care as they once were. Indie game development really helped to reinvigorate both the sprite-based action-platformer genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein\\'s games combine what we\\\\u2019ve always loved about tight-action 2D gaming with splendid influences from more modern games like Dark Souls. The dedication to your actions necessitated by animation locks; the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that this quaint little heroine can tackle these heroic endeavors; the attention to detail in the environments, designs, and animations... all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect. Then there\\\\u2019s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You\\'re trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...? Momodora: RUTM shouldn\\\\u2019t exactly be categorized as \\\\u201cMetroidvania\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cSouls-like\\\\u201d, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It\\'s a game of its own, and it\\\\u2019s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you\\\\u2019ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7,Processor:,1.2 Ghz or superior,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,256 MB,Storage:,200 MB available space,Minimum:,OS:,OSX 10.12 Sierra or later,Processor:,1.2 Ghz or superior,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,256 MB,Storage:,200 MB available space,Minimum:,OS:,Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or later,Processor:,1.2 Ghz or superior,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,256 MB,Storage:,200 MB available space\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7,Processor:,2 Ghz,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,1 GB (with Pixel Shader support),Storage:,200 MB available space,Recommended:,OS:,OSX 10.12 Sierra or later,Processor:,2 Ghz,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,1 GB (with Pixel Shader support),Storage:,200 MB available space,Recommended:,OS:,Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or later,Processor:,2 Ghz,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,1 GB (with Pixel Shader support),Storage:,200 MB available space\", \"originalPrice\": \"$67.96\"}, {\"_id\": 429660, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/429660/Tales_of_Berseria/\", \"name\": \"Tales of Berseria\\\\u2122\", \"descSnippet\": \"Players embark on a journey of self-discovery as they assume the role of Velvet, a young woman whose once kind demeanor has been replaced and overcome with a festering anger and hatred after a traumatic experience three years prior to the events within Tales of Berseria.\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 82, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 91, \"allReviewsCount\": 6288, \"allReviewsPercent\": 93, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1485356400000}, \"developer\": \"BANDAI NAMCO Studios Inc.\", \"publisher\": \"BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment,BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment\", \"popularTags\": \"Anime,JRPG,RPG,Female Protagonist,Story Rich,Fantasy,Action,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Open World,Adventure,Great Soundtrack,Hack and Slash,Cute,Sexual Content,Nudity,Local Co-Op,Multiplayer,Mature,Co-op\", \"gameDetails\": \"Single-player,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud\", \"languages\": \"English,French,Italian,German,Spanish - Spain,Japanese,Portuguese - Brazil,Russian,Traditional Chinese\", \"achievements\": \"51.0\", \"genre\": \"Action,RPG\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game A tale of emotion versus reason\\\\u2026  In Tales of Berseria, players embark on a journey of self-discovery as they assume the role of Velvet, a young woman whose once kind demeanor has been replaced and overcome with a festering anger and hatred after a traumatic experience three years prior to the events within Tales of Berseria.

NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player\\'s presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source\\\\u00ae, Valve\\'s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \\\\\"muscles,\\\\\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.  Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.  Graphics: Source\\'s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story\\\\u00ae and Monster\\'s, Inc.\\\\u00ae, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.  AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.  \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"\", \"originalPrice\": \"$9.99\"}, {\"_id\": 240, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/\", \"name\": \"Counter-Strike: Source\", \"descSnippet\": \"Just updated to include player stats, achievements, new scoreboards and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 439, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 94, \"allReviewsCount\": 45829, \"allReviewsPercent\": 95, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1099234800000}, \"developer\": \"Valve\", \"publisher\": \"Valve,Valve\", \"popularTags\": \"Shooter,Action,FPS,Multiplayer,Team-Based,First-Person,Tactical,Competitive,PvP,e-sports,Military,War,Strategy,Moddable,Difficult,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Survival,Simulation,Sandbox\", \"gameDetails\": \"Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Includes Source SDK\", \"languages\": \"English,French,German,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Russian,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese,Thai,Turkish\", \"achievements\": \"147.0\", \"genre\": \"Action\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE WORLD\\'S # 1 ONLINE ACTION GAME Counter-Strike: Source blends Counter-Strike\\'s award-winning teamplay action with the advanced technology of Source\\\\u2122 technology.

The Imperator Augustus Campaign Pack is set in 42 BC during the chaotic aftermath of Caesar\\\\u2019s grisly murder. The republic remains whole, but its soul is divided as three great men, the members of the Second Triumvirate, hold the future of Rome in the palms of their hands. Octavian, Caesar\\\\u2019s adoptive son and the heir to his legacy. Marc Antony, Caesar\\\\u2019s loyal friend and most trusted lieutenant. Lepidus, Pontifex Maximus of Rome and the man who secured Caesar\\\\u2019s dictatorship. With the territories of The Republic divided between them and the military might of Rome at their beck-and-call, the members of The Second Triumvirate are each in a position to make a bid for leadership, and rule Rome as its first \\\\u2013 and only \\\\u2013 emperor. However, external forces are on the move, looking to exploit the instability of Rome and expand their own territories. Will you fight as a defender of Rome and defeat the other members of the Triumvirate? Or lead another faction on a campaign of conquest and expansion, and take advantage of the chaos as the Roman civil war rages? Playable Factions Players may embark on a new Campaign as one of the following playable factions: Marc Antony Lepidus Octavian Pompey Iceni Marcomanni Dacia Egypt Parthia Armenia (also now playable in the ROME II Grand Campaign).

Your ascension will bring both admiration and jealousy, even from your closest allies. Will you suffer betrayal or will you be the first to turn on old friends?

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\\\\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies\\' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can\\\\u2019t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper\\'s nest. You are the enemy\\'s constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire\\'s strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.

The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid \\\\u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET \\\\u2013 The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician \\\\\"The Elephant\\\\\", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level \\\\u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios \\\\u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.

Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever \\\\u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications \\\\u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way \\\\u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.

This is DayZ, this is your story. DayZ is an unforgiving, authentic, open world sandbox online game where each one of 60 players on a server follows a single goal - to survive as long as they can, by all means necessary. There are no superficial tips, waypoints, built-in tutorials or help given to you. Every decision matters - with no save games, and no extra lives, every mistake can be lethal. If you fail, you lose everything and start over. Scavenging for supplies and roaming the open world never feels safe in DayZ, as you never know what\\'s behind the next corner. Hostile player interactions, or simply just struggling through severe weather can easily turn into intense, nerve-racking moments where you experience very real emotions. On the other hand, meeting with another friendly survivor in DayZ can lead to a true friendship that lasts a lifetime... Your choices and your decisions create a gameplay experience that\\'s completely unique and unequivocally personal - unmatched by any other multiplayer game out there. This is DayZ, this is your story. Key Features Detailed, authentic backdrop of Chernarus, an open world terrain featuring 230 square kilometers of hand-crafted environment based on real life locations. Real emotional experience driven by the emergent interactions of 60 players on the server, all fighting for survival by any means necessary. Environmental dangers including the infected, dynamic weather, and animal predators. Wide variety of complex survival mechanics - from hunting and crafting, through sophisticated injury simulation, to transferable diseases. Persistent servers with complex loot economy, and the ability to build improvised bases. Visceral, authentic gun play and melee combat systems. Smooth and reactive character controller utilizing a detailed animation system. Rewarding and authentic experience of driving vehicles for travel and material transport. Robust technology platform featuring modules of Bohemia\\'s new Enfusion Engine. Seamless network synchronization and significantly improved game performance. A platform fully open to user created content, offering the same tool set that we use for actual game development. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7/8.1 64-bit,Processor:,Intel Core i5-4430,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,16 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX\\\\u00ae-compatible,Additional Notes:,Internet connection\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 10 64-bit,Processor:,Intel Core i5-6600K or AMD R5 1600X,Memory:,12 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD RX 580,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,25 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX\\\\u00ae-compatible,Additional Notes:,Internet connection\", \"originalPrice\": \"$44.99\"}, {\"_id\": 221380, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/Age_of_Empires_II_HD/\", \"name\": \"Age of Empires II HD\", \"descSnippet\": \"Age of Empires II has been re-imagined in high definition with new features, trading cards, improved AI, workshop support, multiplayer, Steamworks integration and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 533, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 93, \"allReviewsCount\": 46206, \"allReviewsPercent\": 94, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1365433200000}, \"developer\": \"Skybox Labs,Hidden Path Entertainment,Ensemble Studios,Forgotten Empires\", \"publisher\": \"Xbox Game Studios,Xbox Game Studios\", \"popularTags\": \"Strategy,RTS,Medieval,Multiplayer,Classic,Historical,Base Building,City Builder,Resource Management,Singleplayer,Tactical,Real-Time,Co-op,Competitive,Masterpiece,Replay Value,Remake,2D,Action,Isometric\", \"gameDetails\": \"Single-player,Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Captions available,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Includes level editor\", \"languages\": \"English,German,French,Italian,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Simplified Chinese,Russian,Japanese,Dutch,Portuguese - Brazil\", \"achievements\": \"294.0\", \"genre\": \"Strategy\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game In Age of Empires II: HD Edition, fans of the original game and new players alike will fall in love with the classic Age of Empires II experience.

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \\\\\"tug of war\\\\\". Ambush --- A high value target (\\\\\"HVT\\\\\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\\'s one team\\'s goal to make this happen and it\\'s the other team\\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\\'s goal is to take the enemy\\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum,OS:,Windows\\\\u00ae 7,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom\\\\u2122 X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel\\\\u00ae or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.98\"}, {\"_id\": 223470, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/POSTAL_2/\", \"name\": \"POSTAL 2\", \"descSnippet\": \"Live a week in the life of \\\\\"The Postal Dude\\\\\"; a hapless everyman just trying to check off some chores.

Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front Challenging game modes: Team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, and skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, desperate survival in Squad Defense and epic 64 player Frontlines including bot support. WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with.

Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun and Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts.

It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets.

Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn\\'t use technologies that wouldn\\'t be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you! Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica\\'s oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meagre supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls \\\\\"the pinnacle of an entire genre\\\\\". The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes two of the five episodes that form its Season One. Both episodes were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - \\\\u201cDo Not Go Gentle\\\\u201d Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - \\\\u201cLuminance Fugue\\\\u201d Mackenzie\\\\u2019s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? The first two episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 15 hours of gameplay. Episodes Three to Five are included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION & CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. SCOUR THE WORLD FOR SUPPLIES Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. A VAST LIVING WORLD Explore a 50 square kilometre Northern Canadian wilderness in search of precious supplies. In Winter. Dynamic time of day, weather, wildlife presence, etc. provide just enough randomness to keep things challenging. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Five Challenges exist at launch, with more on the way in future updates. In addition to releasing the remaining three episodes of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode, as we have done with about 100 updates/hotfixes over the past three years of Early Access. Keep in mind that your purchase of The Long Dark entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE, as well as updates to Survival Mode along the way.

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\\\\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\\\\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \\\\\"Engrams\\\\\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you\\'ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \\\\\"Explorer Notes\\\\\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\\\\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK\\'s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique \\'Procedurally Generated ARKs\\', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

The Survivors\\' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at http://www.deadbydaylight.com Key Features \\\\u2022 Survive Together\\\\u2026 Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish.

Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You\\\\u2019ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies! Jason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes! Fans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including: Friday the 13th, Part II Friday the 13th, Part III Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives Friday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday How Will You Survive?  The entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence. Friday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike! Play as the Counselors! We all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor! Camp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory! Mirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey. Players will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods! Your Crystal Lake Database Friday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account. The longer you play, the more you\\'ll unlock from counselor customization to new Jason Voorhees costumes seen in the movies! Besides giving you personalized camp counselors, you\\'ll be able to unlock secrets within Camp Crystal Lake, exploring the mystery surrounding Jason Voorhees and the grounds he patrols! Be Kind. Rewind.  Every aspect of Friday the 13th: The Game is drawn straight from movies you know and love.

A card can costs between 0-10 mana and your mana regenerates over time during the match. There are 2 bridges in the middle that you need to capture and hold. They generate experience so your hero can level up his abilities before the enemy. You place minions on your side of the arena and the goal is to have them destroy the enemy\\\\u2019s tower. Minions have minds of their own and once you have summoned them, they can no longer be controlled, so place them wisely! Most minions have unique abilities. A few examples of this are: AOE damage, healing, teleporting, mana regen, flying and many more. Spells can be used to change the flow of the game in your favour. Spells such as healing, mind control or stuns can be devastating in the hands of a skilled player. Each hero has unique abilities that change the game drastically as they become active.

This new season moves the contest from the rugged, enclosed indoor arenas to the lush forests, rolling fields, and rugged terrains of TEC1\\\\u2019\\\\u2019s own private SCUM Island. Both fan favorites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of survival while battling for the support of viewers, producers, and corporate sponsors for fame, gifts, and a chance of life after death. SCUM aims to evolve the multiplayer open world survival game with unprecedented levels of character customization, control and progression, where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival. Combining the methodical planning and management of hardcore survival with optional PvP \\\\u2018network events\\\\u2019 available to everyone at anytime, SCUM strikes a unique balance between complex simulation and intense action in the next generation of survival game. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev blogs on scumgame.com and on Twitter @SCUMgame. FEATURES [ALPHA] Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems to allow players to go as deep as they choose into the management of their character. Players can delve into the minutia of the survival experience through systems controlling their character\\\\u2019s metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details... Massive Landscape: Traverse and explore 144 sq km of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns, and rundown airfields. Initially, the massive terrain will be handled by foot and as development continues vehicles will be introduced for quicker movement. PvP Network Events: Enter TEC1\\\\u2019s ongoing network events with a click of a button and be whisked to enclosed areas of the island for white-knuckle PvP gameplay. Volunteer for an event and be pitted against other prisoners with fame points and high value loot on the line for those that survive. Expanding Gameplay: While the current version of SCUM already includes basic crafting, combat, and customization systems, the featureset and gameplay will continually expand to include more advanced mechanics, more variety in gameplay, and a metanarrative for players to complete missions with hopes of one day getting off the island... Online Multiplayer: Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server right from the in-game menu.

HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD, HIGH TENSION Hunt\\\\u2019s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, depending on whether you have chosen team play or solo play, up to five teams of two or ten solo players set out to track their monstrous targets. Once they\\\\u2019ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty\\\\u2014and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map.

Hunt\\'s Quick Play game mode offers a shorter match, during which up to ten individual players race to scavenge gear and find and close four rifts as they compete for a diminishing pool of bounty. First Hunter to the final rift absorbs its energy, but must survive the final count down to complete the mission\\\\u2014while the other Hunters attempt to take them out and take the prize for themselves. When the timer runs out the winner keeps their Hunter, while the rest perish. PROGRESSION Even in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline.

Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target.

Still being in the beta phase, the game can contain a number of bugs and errors which are usually spotted by a large team of testers and fixed quickly after. It is a completely free horror game based on SCP Foundation creepypasta series. The Foundation focuses on protecting the world from any entity, object or phenomenon which exceeds the all-known idea of normal. The underground facility suffers from multiple breaches from various SCP objects which escape their containment chambers. During this events chain, players are given roles to play: Class-D Personnel - Prisoners kept for a purpose of being lab rats. Their mission is to escape the facility without getting any attention from others. Nine-Tailed Fox - Team designated to neutralize the danger and rescue Scientists. Scientist - Breach attendant that tries to escape the facility alive. SCP Object - anomaly trying to kill as many people as possible. Currently, only few SCP objects can be found in-game, but progressively their number will grow in oncoming updates. Chaos Insurgency - Foundation traitors, trying to help Class D to escape in order to obtain helpful information. The randomly generated facility and role division make every game special and full of sensations!

As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., \\\\u201cAnything goes in this sex andron\\\\u201d; \\\\u201cThat is love, this is commerce. What are you into?\\\\u201d); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door.

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\\\\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies\\' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can\\\\u2019t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper\\'s nest. You are the enemy\\'s constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire\\'s strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.

More Masks than Ever \\\\u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications \\\\u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \\\\\"tug of war\\\\\". Ambush --- A high value target (\\\\\"HVT\\\\\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\\'s one team\\'s goal to make this happen and it\\'s the other team\\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\\'s goal is to take the enemy\\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum,OS:,Windows\\\\u00ae 7,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom\\\\u2122 X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel\\\\u00ae or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.98\"}, {\"_id\": 230410, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/230410/Warframe/\", \"name\": \"Warframe\", \"descSnippet\": \"Warframe is a cooperative free-to-play third person online action game set in an evolving sci-fi world.\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 2837, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 83, \"allReviewsCount\": 250319, \"allReviewsPercent\": 91, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1364137200000}, \"developer\": \"Digital Extremes\", \"publisher\": \"Digital Extremes,Digital Extremes\", \"popularTags\": \"Free to Play,Action,Co-op,Multiplayer,Third-Person Shooter,Sci-fi,Ninja,Shooter,Parkour,Space,Online Co-Op,Futuristic,Third Person,PvE,Massively Multiplayer,RPG,Hack and Slash,Singleplayer,FPS,Cyberpunk\", \"gameDetails\": \"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Trading Cards,In-App Purchases,Partial Controller Support\", \"languages\": \"English,German,French,Italian,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Simplified Chinese,Russian,Japanese,Polish,Portuguese - Brazil,Traditional Chinese,Turkish,Ukrainian\", \"achievements\": \"187.0\", \"genre\": \"Action,Free to Play\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game  CHOOSE YOUR WARFRAME With more than 30 Warframes, each fully customizable with their own unique abilities, you can create the perfect Warframe for you.

Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed.  Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.  The Survivors\\' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at http://www.deadbydaylight.com Key Features \\\\u2022 Survive Together\\\\u2026 Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? \\\\u2022 Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you\\\\u2019ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. \\\\u2022 A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer\\\\u2019s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. \\\\u2022 Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. \\\\u2022 Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it\\\\u2019s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what\\\\u2019s hiding in the fog. \", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content  \", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,64-bit Operating Systems (Windows 7, Windows 8.1),Processor:,Intel Core i3-4170 or AMD FX-8120,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,DX11 Compatible GeForce GTX 460 1GB or AMD HD 6850 1GB,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,25 GB available space,Sound Card:,DX11 compatible,Additional Notes:,With these requirements, it is recommended that the game is played on Low quality settings.\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,64-bit Operating Systems (Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or above),Processor:,Intel Core i3-4170 or AMD FX-8300 or higher,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,DX11 Compatible GeForce 760 or AMD HD 8800 or higher with 4GB of RAM,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,25 GB available space,Sound Card:,DX11 compatible\", \"originalPrice\": \"$19.99\"}, {\"_id\": 444090, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/444090/Paladins/\", \"name\": \"Paladins\\\\u00ae\", \"descSnippet\": \"Join 25+ million players in Paladins, the free-to-play fantasy team-based shooter sensation.

NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player\\'s presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source\\\\u00ae, Valve\\'s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \\\\\"muscles,\\\\\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.  Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.  Graphics: Source\\'s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story\\\\u00ae and Monster\\'s, Inc.\\\\u00ae, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.  AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.  \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"\", \"originalPrice\": \"$9.99\"}, {\"_id\": 240, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/\", \"name\": \"Counter-Strike: Source\", \"descSnippet\": \"Just updated to include player stats, achievements, new scoreboards and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 439, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 94, \"allReviewsCount\": 45829, \"allReviewsPercent\": 95, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1099234800000}, \"developer\": \"Valve\", \"publisher\": \"Valve,Valve\", \"popularTags\": \"Shooter,Action,FPS,Multiplayer,Team-Based,First-Person,Tactical,Competitive,PvP,e-sports,Military,War,Strategy,Moddable,Difficult,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Survival,Simulation,Sandbox\", \"gameDetails\": \"Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Includes Source SDK\", \"languages\": \"English,French,German,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Russian,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese,Thai,Turkish\", \"achievements\": \"147.0\", \"genre\": \"Action\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE WORLD\\'S # 1 ONLINE ACTION GAME Counter-Strike: Source blends Counter-Strike\\'s award-winning teamplay action with the advanced technology of Source\\\\u2122 technology.

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\\\\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies\\' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can\\\\u2019t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper\\'s nest. You are the enemy\\'s constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire\\'s strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.

PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level \\\\u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios \\\\u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.

More Masks than Ever \\\\u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications \\\\u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives.

Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \\\\\"tug of war\\\\\". Ambush --- A high value target (\\\\\"HVT\\\\\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\\'s one team\\'s goal to make this happen and it\\'s the other team\\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\\'s goal is to take the enemy\\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum,OS:,Windows\\\\u00ae 7,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom\\\\u2122 X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel\\\\u00ae or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.98\"}, {\"_id\": 223470, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/POSTAL_2/\", \"name\": \"POSTAL 2\", \"descSnippet\": \"Live a week in the life of \\\\\"The Postal Dude\\\\\"; a hapless everyman just trying to check off some chores.

Forage wild fruits and vegetables. Hunt animals for pelts and meat, or in some hostile environments become the prey. Fish for food and garbage. Plant a crop and make sure it gets rain. Seek warmth and take shelter from blizzards. DEAL WITH OTHER PLAYERS Friend or foe there\\'s a lot of interesting people online. Arrest bandits with handcuffs and blindfold them as a non-lethal strategy. Fight with every kind of weapon under the sun - swords, machine guns, snipers, missiles, landmines - you name it. Raid enemy encampments using charges and detonators and steal their loot. For pure PvP play arena mode in a last man standing battle to the death, or PvE for peaceful cooperation. Roleplay servers encourage everyone to stay in character and tell a story together. HELP THE NEW SOCIETY Plenty to do even if you\\'re offline or going solo. Meet, talk and trade with NPCs. Complete quests to aid NPCs and progress the story. Fend off waves of the undead to clear hordes. Secure airdropped supplies. Gear up with gasmasks to scout radioactive deadzones. FORTIFY YOUR STRONGHOLD Somewhere to kick back and chillax or a hideout to direct your gang, whatever floats your boat (in this case sometimes literally). Build with barricades, furniture, traps, machinery and more. Board up the windows of existing structures to survive the night. Craft an entirely new structure from supplies you collect. Turn your vehicle into a moving fortress by building on it. TRAVEL BY LAND, AIR AND SEA Roll out in style with a fully stocked garage. Land vehicles including tanks, quads and snowmobiles.

To create this game, Unity engine was used to provide higher stability and more details. Still being in the beta phase, the game can contain a number of bugs and errors which are usually spotted by a large team of testers and fixed quickly after. It is a completely free horror game based on SCP Foundation creepypasta series. The Foundation focuses on protecting the world from any entity, object or phenomenon which exceeds the all-known idea of normal. The underground facility suffers from multiple breaches from various SCP objects which escape their containment chambers. During this events chain, players are given roles to play: Class-D Personnel - Prisoners kept for a purpose of being lab rats. Their mission is to escape the facility without getting any attention from others. Nine-Tailed Fox - Team designated to neutralize the danger and rescue Scientists. Scientist - Breach attendant that tries to escape the facility alive. SCP Object - anomaly trying to kill as many people as possible. Currently, only few SCP objects can be found in-game, but progressively their number will grow in oncoming updates. Chaos Insurgency - Foundation traitors, trying to help Class D to escape in order to obtain helpful information. The randomly generated facility and role division make every game special and full of sensations! You never know where you are heading or what awaits you behind the next door, no matter what role you are playing. The winner team is one that finished all of its objectives. There are many ways of fighting against enemies, from using firearms to detonating the whole facility with a hydrogen bomb. In the game, we can encounter such anomalies like: SCP-173 - Living concrete sculpture that can move only when not observed, killing people by snapping opponents\\' necks. SCP-106 - Humanoid able to walk past matter, sending its prey to its Pocket Dimension. SCP-049 - Plague doctor trying to \\\\\"cure\\\\\" everyone he meets. SCP-914 - Object improving machinery. SCP-096 - \\\\\"Shy Guy\\\\\" who screams and goes on a rampage upon looking at him. SCP-939 - A monster, which can only see if you make sound. SCP-079 - Sentient AI, which tries to stay on during the breach. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP 1; 64 bit,Processor:,Core i3,Memory:,3 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GT 720 1GB VRAM; DX11 required; Intel Graphics not supported,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP 1, 8.1 or 10; 64 bit,Processor:,Core i5,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 2GB VRAM; DX11 required; Intel Graphics not supported,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space\", \"originalPrice\": \"Free\"}, {\"_id\": 755790, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/755790/Ring_of_Elysium/\", \"name\": \"Ring of Elysium\", \"descSnippet\": \"Escape an astonishing disaster in Ring of Elysium, a battle royale shooter developed by Aurora Studio.\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 1488, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 61, \"allReviewsCount\": 54938, \"allReviewsPercent\": 74, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1537282800000}, \"developer\": \"Aurora Studio\", \"publisher\": \"TCH Scarlet Limited,TCH Scarlet Limited\", \"popularTags\": \"Early Access,Free to Play,Battle Royale,Shooter,Multiplayer,Survival,Early Access,Action,Massively Multiplayer,FPS,Third-Person Shooter,Open World,PvP,Co-op,First-Person,Tactical,Violent,Sandbox,Gore,Destruction\", \"gameDetails\": \"Online Multi-Player\", \"languages\": \"English,Simplified Chinese\", \"achievements\": \"\", \"genre\": \"Action,Free to Play,Massively Multiplayer,Early Access\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game  \", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  Includes intense violence and blood.  \", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10,Processor:,Intel i3 8130U(2Cores, 2.3GHz) or equivalent,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 or equivalent,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX-compatible using the latest drivers\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit version),Processor:,Intel i5 2500(4 Core, 3.3HGz) or equivalent,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or equivalent,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX-compatible using the latest drivers\", \"originalPrice\": \"Free To Play\"}, {\"_id\": 813820, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/813820/Realm_Royale/\", \"name\": \"Realm Royale\", \"descSnippet\": \"Be the last Champion standing in Realm Royale!

NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player\\'s presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source\\\\u00ae, Valve\\'s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \\\\\"muscles,\\\\\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.  Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.  Graphics: Source\\'s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story\\\\u00ae and Monster\\'s, Inc.\\\\u00ae, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.  AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.  \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"\", \"originalPrice\": \"$9.99\"}, {\"_id\": 240, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/\", \"name\": \"Counter-Strike: Source\", \"descSnippet\": \"Just updated to include player stats, achievements, new scoreboards and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 439, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 94, \"allReviewsCount\": 45829, \"allReviewsPercent\": 95, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1099234800000}, \"developer\": \"Valve\", \"publisher\": \"Valve,Valve\", \"popularTags\": \"Shooter,Action,FPS,Multiplayer,Team-Based,First-Person,Tactical,Competitive,PvP,e-sports,Military,War,Strategy,Moddable,Difficult,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Survival,Simulation,Sandbox\", \"gameDetails\": \"Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Includes Source SDK\", \"languages\": \"English,French,German,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Russian,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese,Thai,Turkish\", \"achievements\": \"147.0\", \"genre\": \"Action\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE WORLD\\'S # 1 ONLINE ACTION GAME Counter-Strike: Source blends Counter-Strike\\'s award-winning teamplay action with the advanced technology of Source\\\\u2122 technology.

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\\\\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies\\' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can\\\\u2019t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper\\'s nest. You are the enemy\\'s constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire\\'s strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.

CRIMENET \\\\u2013 The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician \\\\\"The Elephant\\\\\", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level \\\\u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios \\\\u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills \\\\u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever \\\\u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications \\\\u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way \\\\u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly. New Game Content All the Time \\\\u2013 More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. Every month offers new free content and paid DLC as PAYDAY 2 continues to be developed by the OVERKILL crew until at least 2017. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7,Processor:,2 GHz Intel Dual Core Processor,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia & AMD (512MB VRAM),DirectX\\\\u00ae:,9.0c,Hard Drive:,31 GB HD space,Sound:,DirectX 9.0c compatible,Minimum:,OS:,SteamOS,Processor:,2 GHz Intel Dual Core Processor,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia & AMD (512MB VRAM),DirectX\\\\u00ae:,9.0c,Hard Drive:,31 GB HD space,Sound:,DirectX 9.0c compatible\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 10,Processor:,2.3 GHz Intel Quad Core Processor,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia & AMD (1GB VRAM),DirectX\\\\u00ae:,9.0c,Hard Drive:,45 GB HD space,Sound:,DirectX 9.0c compatible,Recommended:,OS:,SteamOS,Processor:,2.3 GHz Intel Quad Core Processor,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia & AMD (1GB VRAM),DirectX\\\\u00ae:,9.0c,Hard Drive:,45 GB HD space,Sound:,DirectX 9.0c compatible\", \"originalPrice\": \"$9.99\"}, {\"_id\": 219640, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/219640/Chivalry_Medieval_Warfare/\", \"name\": \"Chivalry: Medieval Warfare\", \"descSnippet\": \"Besiege castles and raid villages in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, a fast-paced medieval first person slasher with a focus on multiplayer battles\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 262, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 51, \"allReviewsCount\": 43174, \"allReviewsPercent\": 82, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1350313200000}, \"developer\": \"Torn Banner Studios\", \"publisher\": \"Torn Banner Studios,Torn Banner Studios\", \"popularTags\": \"Medieval,Multiplayer,Action,Gore,First-Person,Swordplay,Violent,PvP,Third Person,Indie,Competitive,Team-Based,Hack and Slash,FPS,Historical,Class-Based,Co-op,Atmospheric,Simulation,Difficult\", \"gameDetails\": \"Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Includes level editor\", \"languages\": \"English,German,French,Italian,Spanish - Spain,Russian,Polish,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese\", \"achievements\": \"49.0\", \"genre\": \"Action,Indie\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game Besiege castles and raid villages in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a first-person slasher with a focus on multi-player.

Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \\\\\"tug of war\\\\\". Ambush --- A high value target (\\\\\"HVT\\\\\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\\'s one team\\'s goal to make this happen and it\\'s the other team\\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\\'s goal is to take the enemy\\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum,OS:,Windows\\\\u00ae 7,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom\\\\u2122 X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel\\\\u00ae or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.98\"}, {\"_id\": 223470, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/POSTAL_2/\", \"name\": \"POSTAL 2\", \"descSnippet\": \"Live a week in the life of \\\\\"The Postal Dude\\\\\"; a hapless everyman just trying to check off some chores.

A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you! Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica\\'s oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

Forage wild fruits and vegetables. Hunt animals for pelts and meat, or in some hostile environments become the prey. Fish for food and garbage. Plant a crop and make sure it gets rain. Seek warmth and take shelter from blizzards. DEAL WITH OTHER PLAYERS Friend or foe there\\'s a lot of interesting people online. Arrest bandits with handcuffs and blindfold them as a non-lethal strategy. Fight with every kind of weapon under the sun - swords, machine guns, snipers, missiles, landmines - you name it.

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meagre supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls \\\\\"the pinnacle of an entire genre\\\\\". The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes two of the five episodes that form its Season One. Both episodes were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - \\\\u201cDo Not Go Gentle\\\\u201d Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - \\\\u201cLuminance Fugue\\\\u201d Mackenzie\\\\u2019s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? The first two episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 15 hours of gameplay. Episodes Three to Five are included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION & CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. SCOUR THE WORLD FOR SUPPLIES Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. A VAST LIVING WORLD Explore a 50 square kilometre Northern Canadian wilderness in search of precious supplies. In Winter. Dynamic time of day, weather, wildlife presence, etc. provide just enough randomness to keep things challenging. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Five Challenges exist at launch, with more on the way in future updates. In addition to releasing the remaining three episodes of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode, as we have done with about 100 updates/hotfixes over the past three years of Early Access. Keep in mind that your purchase of The Long Dark entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE, as well as updates to Survival Mode along the way.

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\\\\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\\\\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \\\\\"Engrams\\\\\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you\\'ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \\\\\"Explorer Notes\\\\\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\\\\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK\\'s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique \\'Procedurally Generated ARKs\\', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously\\\\u2014and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters\\\\u2014called your Bloodline\\\\u2014always. HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD, HIGH TENSION Hunt\\\\u2019s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, depending on whether you have chosen team play or solo play, up to five teams of two or ten solo players set out to track their monstrous targets. Once they\\\\u2019ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty\\\\u2014and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don\\\\u2019t watch your back, you\\\\u2019ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of someone else walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the reward\\\\u2013but a single mistake could cost you everything. Hunt\\'s Quick Play game mode offers a shorter match, during which up to ten individual players race to scavenge gear and find and close four rifts as they compete for a diminishing pool of bounty. First Hunter to the final rift absorbs its energy, but must survive the final count down to complete the mission\\\\u2014while the other Hunters attempt to take them out and take the prize for themselves. When the timer runs out the winner keeps their Hunter, while the rest perish. PROGRESSION Even in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience. DARK SIGHT Dark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target. Dark Sight also marks players carrying a bounty, making them more vulnerable to ambush while trying to escape.\", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content  \", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 64bit,Processor:,Intel i5-4590 @ 3.3GHz (4th Generation) or AMD Ryzen 3 1200,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 TI or AMD Radeon R7 370,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX compatible audio card,Additional Notes:,Best experienced with headphones\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10 64 bit,Processor:,Intel i5-6600 @ 3.3Ghz (6th Generation) or AMD Ryzen 5 1400,Memory:,12 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4 GB or AMD Radeon R9 390X,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX compatible audio card,Additional Notes:,Best experienced with headphones\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.99\"}, {\"_id\": 611500, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/611500/Quake_Champions/\", \"name\": \"Quake Champions\", \"descSnippet\": \"Quake\\\\u00ae Champions is a fast-paced Arena shooter, a genre established by the original Quake 20 years ago.

To create this game, Unity engine was used to provide higher stability and more details. Still being in the beta phase, the game can contain a number of bugs and errors which are usually spotted by a large team of testers and fixed quickly after. It is a completely free horror game based on SCP Foundation creepypasta series. The Foundation focuses on protecting the world from any entity, object or phenomenon which exceeds the all-known idea of normal. The underground facility suffers from multiple breaches from various SCP objects which escape their containment chambers. During this events chain, players are given roles to play: Class-D Personnel - Prisoners kept for a purpose of being lab rats. Their mission is to escape the facility without getting any attention from others. Nine-Tailed Fox - Team designated to neutralize the danger and rescue Scientists. Scientist - Breach attendant that tries to escape the facility alive. SCP Object - anomaly trying to kill as many people as possible. Currently, only few SCP objects can be found in-game, but progressively their number will grow in oncoming updates. Chaos Insurgency - Foundation traitors, trying to help Class D to escape in order to obtain helpful information. The randomly generated facility and role division make every game special and full of sensations! You never know where you are heading or what awaits you behind the next door, no matter what role you are playing. The winner team is one that finished all of its objectives. There are many ways of fighting against enemies, from using firearms to detonating the whole facility with a hydrogen bomb. In the game, we can encounter such anomalies like: SCP-173 - Living concrete sculpture that can move only when not observed, killing people by snapping opponents\\' necks. SCP-106 - Humanoid able to walk past matter, sending its prey to its Pocket Dimension. SCP-049 - Plague doctor trying to \\\\\"cure\\\\\" everyone he meets. SCP-914 - Object improving machinery. SCP-096 - \\\\\"Shy Guy\\\\\" who screams and goes on a rampage upon looking at him. SCP-939 - A monster, which can only see if you make sound. SCP-079 - Sentient AI, which tries to stay on during the breach. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP 1; 64 bit,Processor:,Core i3,Memory:,3 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GT 720 1GB VRAM; DX11 required; Intel Graphics not supported,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP 1, 8.1 or 10; 64 bit,Processor:,Core i5,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 2GB VRAM; DX11 required; Intel Graphics not supported,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space\", \"originalPrice\": \"Free\"}, {\"_id\": 755790, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/755790/Ring_of_Elysium/\", \"name\": \"Ring of Elysium\", \"descSnippet\": \"Escape an astonishing disaster in Ring of Elysium, a battle royale shooter developed by Aurora Studio.\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 1488, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 61, \"allReviewsCount\": 54938, \"allReviewsPercent\": 74, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1537282800000}, \"developer\": \"Aurora Studio\", \"publisher\": \"TCH Scarlet Limited,TCH Scarlet Limited\", \"popularTags\": \"Early Access,Free to Play,Battle Royale,Shooter,Multiplayer,Survival,Early Access,Action,Massively Multiplayer,FPS,Third-Person Shooter,Open World,PvP,Co-op,First-Person,Tactical,Violent,Sandbox,Gore,Destruction\", \"gameDetails\": \"Online Multi-Player\", \"languages\": \"English,Simplified Chinese\", \"achievements\": \"\", \"genre\": \"Action,Free to Play,Massively Multiplayer,Early Access\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game  \", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  Includes intense violence and blood.  \", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10,Processor:,Intel i3 8130U(2Cores, 2.3GHz) or equivalent,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 or equivalent,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX-compatible using the latest drivers\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit version),Processor:,Intel i5 2500(4 Core, 3.3HGz) or equivalent,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or equivalent,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX-compatible using the latest drivers\", \"originalPrice\": \"Free To Play\"}]Moddable : [{\"_id\": 240, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/\", \"name\": \"Counter-Strike: Source\", \"descSnippet\": \"Just updated to include player stats, achievements, new scoreboards and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 439, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 94, \"allReviewsCount\": 45829, \"allReviewsPercent\": 95, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1099234800000}, \"developer\": \"Valve\", \"publisher\": \"Valve,Valve\", \"popularTags\": \"Shooter,Action,FPS,Multiplayer,Team-Based,First-Person,Tactical,Competitive,PvP,e-sports,Military,War,Strategy,Moddable,Difficult,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Survival,Simulation,Sandbox\", \"gameDetails\": \"Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Includes Source SDK\", \"languages\": \"English,French,German,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Russian,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese,Thai,Turkish\", \"achievements\": \"147.0\", \"genre\": \"Action\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE WORLD\\'S # 1 ONLINE ACTION GAME Counter-Strike: Source blends Counter-Strike\\'s award-winning teamplay action with the advanced technology of Source\\\\u2122 technology.

It also includes the ability to mod the game to suit your play style as a fine counter balance to the layered and challenging simulation. You\\\\u2019re only limited by your imagination, so take control and reach for the sky! Multi-tiered and challenging simulation Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor of your city you\\\\u2019ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, fire fighting, healthcare and much more along with your citys real economy system. Citizens within your city react fluidly, with gravitas and with an air of authenticity to a multitude of game play scenarios. Extensive local traffic simulation Colossal Order\\'s extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is fully utilized in a fully fleshed out and well-crafted local traffic simulation. Districts and Policies Be more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city. Utilize the Day and Night Cycle The city changes during the hours of the day and affects citizen schedules. Traffic is visibly slower at night and some zoned areas do not work with full efficiency. This expansion will put you in control of managing the different aspects of the day and night cycles. Extensive modding support Build or improve on existing maps and structures. You can then import them into the game, share them as well as download the creations of other city builders on the Steam workshop.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1 (64-bit),Processor:,Intel Core 2 Duo, 3.0GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 6400+, 3.2GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards),DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,4 GB available space,Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,OS X 10.9 (64-bit),Processor:,Intel Core 2 Duo, 3.0GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB  (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards),Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,4 GB available space,Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit),Processor:,Intel Core 2 Duo, 3.0GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 6400+, 3.2GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB  (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards),Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,4 GB available space\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Microsoft Windows 7/8 (64-bit),Processor:,Intel Core i5-3470, 3.20GHz or AMD FX-6300, 3.5Ghz,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,nVIDIA GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB or AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GB (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards),DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,4 GB available space,Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,OS X 10.10 (64-bit),Processor:,Intel Core i5-3470, 3.20GHz,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,nVIDIA GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB or AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GB  (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards),Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,4 GB available space,Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Ubuntu 14.10 (64-bit),Processor:,Intel Core i5-3470, 3.20GHz or AMD FX-6300, 3.5Ghz,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,nVIDIA GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB or AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GB  (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards),Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,4 GB available space\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.99\"}, {\"_id\": 271590, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/\", \"name\": \"Grand Theft Auto V\", \"descSnippet\": \"Los Santos is a city of bright lights, long nights and dirty secrets, and they don\\\\u2019t come brighter, longer or dirtier than in GTA Online: After Hours.

NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player\\'s presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source\\\\u00ae, Valve\\'s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \\\\\"muscles,\\\\\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.  Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.  Graphics: Source\\'s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story\\\\u00ae and Monster\\'s, Inc.\\\\u00ae, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.  AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.  \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"\", \"originalPrice\": \"$9.99\"}, {\"_id\": 240, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/\", \"name\": \"Counter-Strike: Source\", \"descSnippet\": \"Just updated to include player stats, achievements, new scoreboards and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 439, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 94, \"allReviewsCount\": 45829, \"allReviewsPercent\": 95, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1099234800000}, \"developer\": \"Valve\", \"publisher\": \"Valve,Valve\", \"popularTags\": \"Shooter,Action,FPS,Multiplayer,Team-Based,First-Person,Tactical,Competitive,PvP,e-sports,Military,War,Strategy,Moddable,Difficult,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Survival,Simulation,Sandbox\", \"gameDetails\": \"Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Includes Source SDK\", \"languages\": \"English,French,German,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Russian,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese,Thai,Turkish\", \"achievements\": \"147.0\", \"genre\": \"Action\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE WORLD\\'S # 1 ONLINE ACTION GAME Counter-Strike: Source blends Counter-Strike\\'s award-winning teamplay action with the advanced technology of Source\\\\u2122 technology.

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\\\\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies\\' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can\\\\u2019t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper\\'s nest. You are the enemy\\'s constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire\\'s strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations.

Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \\\\\"tug of war\\\\\". Ambush --- A high value target (\\\\\"HVT\\\\\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\\'s one team\\'s goal to make this happen and it\\'s the other team\\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\\'s goal is to take the enemy\\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum,OS:,Windows\\\\u00ae 7,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom\\\\u2122 X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel\\\\u00ae or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.98\"}, {\"_id\": 223470, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/POSTAL_2/\", \"name\": \"POSTAL 2\", \"descSnippet\": \"Live a week in the life of \\\\\"The Postal Dude\\\\\"; a hapless everyman just trying to check off some chores.

Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front Challenging game modes: Team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, and skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, desperate survival in Squad Defense and epic 64 player Frontlines including bot support. WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man\\\\u2019s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\\\\u2019t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun and Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts.

HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD, HIGH TENSION Hunt\\\\u2019s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, depending on whether you have chosen team play or solo play, up to five teams of two or ten solo players set out to track their monstrous targets. Once they\\\\u2019ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty\\\\u2014and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don\\\\u2019t watch your back, you\\\\u2019ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of someone else walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the reward\\\\u2013but a single mistake could cost you everything. Hunt\\'s Quick Play game mode offers a shorter match, during which up to ten individual players race to scavenge gear and find and close four rifts as they compete for a diminishing pool of bounty. First Hunter to the final rift absorbs its energy, but must survive the final count down to complete the mission\\\\u2014while the other Hunters attempt to take them out and take the prize for themselves. When the timer runs out the winner keeps their Hunter, while the rest perish. PROGRESSION Even in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience. DARK SIGHT Dark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target. Dark Sight also marks players carrying a bounty, making them more vulnerable to ambush while trying to escape.\", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content  \", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 64bit,Processor:,Intel i5-4590 @ 3.3GHz (4th Generation) or AMD Ryzen 3 1200,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 TI or AMD Radeon R7 370,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX compatible audio card,Additional Notes:,Best experienced with headphones\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10 64 bit,Processor:,Intel i5-6600 @ 3.3Ghz (6th Generation) or AMD Ryzen 5 1400,Memory:,12 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4 GB or AMD Radeon R9 390X,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX compatible audio card,Additional Notes:,Best experienced with headphones\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.99\"}, {\"_id\": 611500, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/611500/Quake_Champions/\", \"name\": \"Quake Champions\", \"descSnippet\": \"Quake\\\\u00ae Champions is a fast-paced Arena shooter, a genre established by the original Quake 20 years ago.

To create this game, Unity engine was used to provide higher stability and more details. Still being in the beta phase, the game can contain a number of bugs and errors which are usually spotted by a large team of testers and fixed quickly after. It is a completely free horror game based on SCP Foundation creepypasta series. The Foundation focuses on protecting the world from any entity, object or phenomenon which exceeds the all-known idea of normal. The underground facility suffers from multiple breaches from various SCP objects which escape their containment chambers. During this events chain, players are given roles to play: Class-D Personnel - Prisoners kept for a purpose of being lab rats. Their mission is to escape the facility without getting any attention from others. Nine-Tailed Fox - Team designated to neutralize the danger and rescue Scientists. Scientist - Breach attendant that tries to escape the facility alive. SCP Object - anomaly trying to kill as many people as possible. Currently, only few SCP objects can be found in-game, but progressively their number will grow in oncoming updates. Chaos Insurgency - Foundation traitors, trying to help Class D to escape in order to obtain helpful information. The randomly generated facility and role division make every game special and full of sensations! You never know where you are heading or what awaits you behind the next door, no matter what role you are playing. The winner team is one that finished all of its objectives. There are many ways of fighting against enemies, from using firearms to detonating the whole facility with a hydrogen bomb. In the game, we can encounter such anomalies like: SCP-173 - Living concrete sculpture that can move only when not observed, killing people by snapping opponents\\' necks. SCP-106 - Humanoid able to walk past matter, sending its prey to its Pocket Dimension. SCP-049 - Plague doctor trying to \\\\\"cure\\\\\" everyone he meets. SCP-914 - Object improving machinery. SCP-096 - \\\\\"Shy Guy\\\\\" who screams and goes on a rampage upon looking at him. SCP-939 - A monster, which can only see if you make sound. SCP-079 - Sentient AI, which tries to stay on during the breach. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP 1; 64 bit,Processor:,Core i3,Memory:,3 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GT 720 1GB VRAM; DX11 required; Intel Graphics not supported,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP 1, 8.1 or 10; 64 bit,Processor:,Core i5,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 2GB VRAM; DX11 required; Intel Graphics not supported,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space\", \"originalPrice\": \"Free\"}, {\"_id\": 755790, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/755790/Ring_of_Elysium/\", \"name\": \"Ring of Elysium\", \"descSnippet\": \"Escape an astonishing disaster in Ring of Elysium, a battle royale shooter developed by Aurora Studio.\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 1488, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 61, \"allReviewsCount\": 54938, \"allReviewsPercent\": 74, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1537282800000}, \"developer\": \"Aurora Studio\", \"publisher\": \"TCH Scarlet Limited,TCH Scarlet Limited\", \"popularTags\": \"Early Access,Free to Play,Battle Royale,Shooter,Multiplayer,Survival,Early Access,Action,Massively Multiplayer,FPS,Third-Person Shooter,Open World,PvP,Co-op,First-Person,Tactical,Violent,Sandbox,Gore,Destruction\", \"gameDetails\": \"Online Multi-Player\", \"languages\": \"English,Simplified Chinese\", \"achievements\": \"\", \"genre\": \"Action,Free to Play,Massively Multiplayer,Early Access\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game  \", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  Includes intense violence and blood.  \", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10,Processor:,Intel i3 8130U(2Cores, 2.3GHz) or equivalent,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 or equivalent,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX-compatible using the latest drivers\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit version),Processor:,Intel i5 2500(4 Core, 3.3HGz) or equivalent,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or equivalent,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX-compatible using the latest drivers\", \"originalPrice\": \"Free To Play\"}, {\"_id\": 813820, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/813820/Realm_Royale/\", \"name\": \"Realm Royale\", \"descSnippet\": \"Be the last Champion standing in Realm Royale!

NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player\\'s presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source\\\\u00ae, Valve\\'s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \\\\\"muscles,\\\\\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.  Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.  Graphics: Source\\'s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story\\\\u00ae and Monster\\'s, Inc.\\\\u00ae, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.  AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.  \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"\", \"originalPrice\": \"$9.99\"}, {\"_id\": 240, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/\", \"name\": \"Counter-Strike: Source\", \"descSnippet\": \"Just updated to include player stats, achievements, new scoreboards and more!\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 439, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 94, \"allReviewsCount\": 45829, \"allReviewsPercent\": 95, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1099234800000}, \"developer\": \"Valve\", \"publisher\": \"Valve,Valve\", \"popularTags\": \"Shooter,Action,FPS,Multiplayer,Team-Based,First-Person,Tactical,Competitive,PvP,e-sports,Military,War,Strategy,Moddable,Difficult,Singleplayer,Atmospheric,Survival,Simulation,Sandbox\", \"gameDetails\": \"Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Includes Source SDK\", \"languages\": \"English,French,German,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Spanish - Spain,Russian,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese,Thai,Turkish\", \"achievements\": \"147.0\", \"genre\": \"Action\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE WORLD\\'S # 1 ONLINE ACTION GAME Counter-Strike: Source blends Counter-Strike\\'s award-winning teamplay action with the advanced technology of Source\\\\u2122 technology.

The Imperator Augustus Campaign Pack is set in 42 BC during the chaotic aftermath of Caesar\\\\u2019s grisly murder. The republic remains whole, but its soul is divided as three great men, the members of the Second Triumvirate, hold the future of Rome in the palms of their hands. Octavian, Caesar\\\\u2019s adoptive son and the heir to his legacy. Marc Antony, Caesar\\\\u2019s loyal friend and most trusted lieutenant. Lepidus, Pontifex Maximus of Rome and the man who secured Caesar\\\\u2019s dictatorship. With the territories of The Republic divided between them and the military might of Rome at their beck-and-call, the members of The Second Triumvirate are each in a position to make a bid for leadership, and rule Rome as its first \\\\u2013 and only \\\\u2013 emperor. However, external forces are on the move, looking to exploit the instability of Rome and expand their own territories. Will you fight as a defender of Rome and defeat the other members of the Triumvirate? Or lead another faction on a campaign of conquest and expansion, and take advantage of the chaos as the Roman civil war rages?

While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid \\\\u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.

PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level \\\\u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios \\\\u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills \\\\u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever \\\\u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications \\\\u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?

Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \\\\\"tug of war\\\\\". Ambush --- A high value target (\\\\\"HVT\\\\\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\\'s one team\\'s goal to make this happen and it\\'s the other team\\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\\'s goal is to take the enemy\\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.\", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum,OS:,Windows\\\\u00ae 7,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom\\\\u2122 X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel\\\\u00ae or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.98\"}, {\"_id\": 223470, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/POSTAL_2/\", \"name\": \"POSTAL 2\", \"descSnippet\": \"Live a week in the life of \\\\\"The Postal Dude\\\\\"; a hapless everyman just trying to check off some chores.

No matter where you go, they will be there, ready to pounce. The time of mortals is ending, and the reign of Chaos draws ever closer. The Dark Gods are at last united in a singular purpose, losing their madness across the world as never before. In the Empire of Sigmar, Karl Franz\\'s gaze is focused on the incursion of the savage northmen, but it is not the only threat. As the Chaos moon Morrslieb waxes full, shrill voices echo through tunnels gnawed far beneath the Empire\\'s cities, and a Skaven host swarms towards the surface. It emerges first in the city of Ubersreik, a screeching mass that consumes all before it. Soon Ubersreik is a charnel-town, drowning beneath the malevolent shadow of the Horned Rat. Yet even in the darkest times, there are always champions to light the way. As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8/8.1 64-bit, Windows 10 64-bit*,Processor:,Intel Core2 Quad Q9500 @ 2.83GHz or AMD Phenom II X4 940,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or AMD Radeon HD 5770 /w 1GB VRAM,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,30 GB available space,Additional Notes:,*WARNING: 32-bit OS is NOT officially supported at this time\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8/8.1 64-bit, Windows 10 64-bit*,Processor:,Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4.00 GHz or AMD FX-9590 @ 4.7 GHz,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 or AMD GPU Radeon R9 290,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,30 GB available space,Additional Notes:,*WARNING: 32-bit OS is NOT officially supported at this time\", \"originalPrice\": \"$29.99\"}, {\"_id\": 236850, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/\", \"name\": \"Europa Universalis IV\", \"descSnippet\": \"The empire building game Europa Universalis IV gives you control of a nation to guide through the years in order to create a dominant global empire.

Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front Challenging game modes: Team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, and skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, desperate survival in Squad Defense and epic 64 player Frontlines including bot support. WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man\\\\u2019s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\\\\u2019t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun and Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man\\'s land in search of the enemy. \", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content.

Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn\\'t use technologies that wouldn\\'t be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn\\\\u2019t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.

When our friends play tested our game they\\\\u2019d instinctively button mash, they couldn\\\\u2019t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game\\\\u2019s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when there\\\\u2019s no enemy in front of you, you\\\\u2019re going to miss. If you miss, chances are you\\\\u2019re going to get hit. It\\\\u2019s a simple system but it\\\\u2019s ruthless to button mashers.

Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.

Now, in XCOM 2 , the aliens rule Earth, building shining cities that promise a brilliant future for humanity on the surface, while concealing a sinister agenda and eliminating all who dissent from their new order. Only those who live at the edges of the world have a margin of freedom. Here, a force gathers once again to stand up for humanity.

Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior. The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism. Environments and vehicles in BeamNG. drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving. We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG. drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be. Why is BeamNG. drive the game for you? As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG. drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in. In some ways, BeamNG. drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don\\'t let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG. drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn\\'t force you to do anything that you don\\'t think is fun or interesting. The future of the game and our physics engine As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor. We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim. Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane\\'s airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge. Alpha Access Features  All future updates to BeamNG. drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game  Soft-body physics sandbox  19 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come  10 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come  Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes  Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay  Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software  Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run. Alpha Testers Users that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key. Our goals Our main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system. Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL. Our mission To have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.

Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It\\\\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \\\\u201crandom\\\\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers \\\\u2013 they\\\\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\\\\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person\\\\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \\\\u2013 but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they\\'ll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You\\'re not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they\\'re too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters\\' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer\\'s leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino\\'s horn, and it\\'s much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he\\'ll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there\\'s much more than that!

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meagre supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out.

The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes two of the five episodes that form its Season One. Both episodes were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - \\\\u201cDo Not Go Gentle\\\\u201d Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - \\\\u201cLuminance Fugue\\\\u201d Mackenzie\\\\u2019s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? The first two episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 15 hours of gameplay. Episodes Three to Five are included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION & CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. SCOUR THE WORLD FOR SUPPLIES Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. A VAST LIVING WORLD Explore a 50 square kilometre Northern Canadian wilderness in search of precious supplies. In Winter. Dynamic time of day, weather, wildlife presence, etc. provide just enough randomness to keep things challenging. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Five Challenges exist at launch, with more on the way in future updates. In addition to releasing the remaining three episodes of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode, as we have done with about 100 updates/hotfixes over the past three years of Early Access.

In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler\\\\u2019s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment \\\\u2013 the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.

Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there\\\\u2019s no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small \\\\u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \\\\u2013 but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don\\\\u2019t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society\\\\u2019s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.

The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart.

Fight human, alien and biological hazards and survive in a hostile galaxy full of hidden dangers. Play as a lone wolf or team-up with your friends, build new friendships, create alliances or make war to conquer the solar system. Empyrion uniquely combines elements from space simulations, construction games, survival games and ego-shooters. In Empyrion, you can forge your destiny in a galaxy with infinite possibilities! Space and Planet Exploration: An absolute free-roaming experience awaits you: warp between planets, fly from planet to moons, land on planets and freely walk around to explore your surroundings. Discover the secrets of different alien races and tangle with the native fauna and flora. A sandbox full of different, vivid planets is waiting for you to explore! Solar System and Open World: The solar system is procedurally generated and features several planets and interesting POIs. Each planet has its own characteristics (planet type, gravity, atmosphere, number of moons, terrain, surface, vegetation, climate, and resources). Building and Construction: Build large capital vessels, small fighters or mighty space stations and vast planetary settlements by yourself - or download a blueprint from the Steam Workshop and customize it with your very own ideas of form and function! Survival Mode: Get out of your escape pod, grab what\\'s left from your ship and prepare to survive in a hostile environment. Food and oxygen are rare, resources are scarce, ammo is low and dangers lurk around each and every corner. Keep your eyes open. You need to be smart and well prepared if you want to survive more than a day on an alien planet far away from Earth. Creative Mode: Just build and make your craziest dreams come true, without having to bother with food, resources or enemies. Join the Creative Community and upload your creations to the Steam Workshop! Singleplayer and Multiplayer Play as a lone wolf in single player or join the multiplayer community: team-up with your friends, build new friendships, create alliances or make war. You can build yourself a comfortable home in a well-protected PvE area or face the permanent dangers of PvP planets to ransack their riches or conquer the solar system with your faction. Wildlife and Enemies: Don\\'t get mislead by the peaceful animal wildlife of some planets and the silence in space. Most of the animal wildlife wants to snack on your leg - and aggressive robot drones, alien soldiers and their guardians will try to hunt you down as soon as you are within sight. Fight for your life and deploy a range of weapons against fierce and obscure alien creatures. Mining and Resource Gathering: For building and construction, you need to gather and mine resources. Dig down to the rich deposits of a planet or drill through an asteroid full of rare ore. You might also plunder alien buildings or scrap any structure you come across. Extensive Crafting System: Learn how to combine resources and building materials to craft your equipment. Craft your stuff in your base or while you are on the move and equip your buildings and vessels with a range of different devices, weapons and gadgets for different purposes. Hunting, Farming and Food System: Grow your own vegetables and fruits or hunt creatures for their meat to prepare yourself a delicious meal. Some plants help to create medical supplies while others can be picked up and consumed for first aid or to quickly settle your empty stomach. Experience and Tech Tree: Do whatever you want - and gain experience points for doing so! Scrap that old stuff and use the points to unlock those shiny new devices in the Techtree. Terrain Deformation: Each planet features a voxel-based terrain. You can entirely modify and deform the terrain: flatten it for your planetary station, dig holes to find resources or build a tunnel system to protect yourself.

Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for. Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with: 64-player battles 6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities: United States Army and Marine Corps North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) Australian Army Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers 4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and Bushranger Asymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppers More than 20 maps 3 distinct game-modes Proximity VOIP And hundreds of character customization options. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong). SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVN The Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms: US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikes Australian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artillery ARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 Skyraiders For mobility, they have access to full helicopter support: UH-1 \\\\u201cHuey\\\\u201d: provides rapid transport for a squad across the map OH-6 \\\\u201cLoach\\\\u201d: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its miniguns AH-1G \\\\u201cCobra\\\\u201d: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officer Australian \\\\u201cBushranger\\\\u201d: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rockets Tactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments! As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time: M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 \\\\u201cgrease gun\\\\u201d, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMG M14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper rifles M60 LMG and M16 automatic rifle For heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrower Explosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 Claymore NORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VC The Northern forces offer a broader mix , with the People\\\\u2019s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has: PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trail NLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrage To compete with the Southern forces\\\\u2019 mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth: NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the lines Given their \\\\u201chome field advantage\\\\u201d, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover can\\\\u2019t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraft SA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right \\\\u201cHo Chi Minh Trail\\\\u201d ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his team\\\\u2019s spawning rate, when times get desperate \\\\u201cAmbush Spawn\\\\u201d ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes. The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons: AK-47 and Type 56 Assault rifles Russian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle MN 91/30 and SVD sniper rifles PPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGs IZh-58 double-barrelled shotgun DP-28 and RPD LMGs RPG-7 rocket launcher MD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps \", \"matureContent\": \" Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content  \", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only),Processor:,Intel Core i3 @ 2.5GHz or AMD Phenom @ 2.5GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or ATI Radeon HD 5850,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,60 GB available space,Additional Notes:,UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE: 32-bit Operating Systems\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only),Processor:,Intel Core i5 @ 3.2GHz or AMD @ 4.0GHz or better,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X or better,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,60 GB available space\", \"originalPrice\": \"$24.99\"}, {\"_id\": 424280, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/424280/Iron_Snout/\", \"name\": \"Iron Snout\", \"descSnippet\": \"Iron Snout is a fast, colorful and brutal fighting game in which you will be helping a piglet fight for its life against hordes of wolves.\", \"recentReviewsCount\": 164, \"recentReviewsPercent\": 98, \"allReviewsCount\": 14306, \"allReviewsPercent\": 98, \"releaseDate\": {\"$date\": 1453820400000}, \"developer\": \"SnoutUp\", \"publisher\": \"SnoutUp,SnoutUp\", \"popularTags\": \"Free to Play,Funny,Action,Fighting,Gore,2D,2D Fighter,Indie,Singleplayer,Cartoon,Survival,Blood,Violent,Fast-Paced,Casual,Arcade,Beat \\'em up,Cute,Difficult,Co-op\", \"gameDetails\": \"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Stats,Steam Leaderboards\", \"languages\": \"English\", \"achievements\": \"37.0\", \"genre\": \"Action,Free to Play,Indie\", \"gameDescription\": \" About This Game  Iron Snout is fast, colorful and brutal button-mash fighting game in which you will be helping a piglet fight for its life against hordes of wolves. fast-paced and bacon-flavored combat movie-like combo moves to fight hilarious (but dangerous) enemies knocking enemy heads and throwing them back at them hyper-responsive controls tons of Steam achievements challenge your friends in Steam leaderboards Other Games https://store.steampowered.com/app/590950/Toaster_Jam/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/646240/Bacon_May_Die/ Special thanks Store art: Steffen Wittig Background music: weirdnoises \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"\", \"originalPrice\": \"Free\"}, {\"_id\": 427520, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/\", \"name\": \"Factorio\", \"descSnippet\": \"Factorio is a game about building and creating automated factories to produce items of increasing complexity, within an infinite 2D world.

The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex \\\\u2013 and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh\\\\u2026 Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill. \", \"matureContent\": \"\", \"minimumRequirements\": \"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7 64Bit,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 2 Duo 3.0Ghz,Memory:,5 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GTX 460 1GB | AMD Radeon HD 5770 1GB | Intel HD4000 @720p,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,60 GB available space,Minimum:,OS:,Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit,Processor:,3.4GHz Intel Core i3-4130,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,2GB Nvidia GTX 680 or better, 2GB AMD R9 285 (GCN 3rd Gen) or better,Storage:,52 GB available space,Additional Notes:,* Requires Vulkan,* Nvidia graphics cards require driver version 396.54 (tested),* AMD GPU\\'s require Mesa 18.1.5 or better (tested),* Intel GPU\\'s are not supported at time of release\", \"recommendedRequirements\": \"Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7 / 8 (8.1)/ 10 64Bit,Processor:,Intel\\\\u00ae Core\\\\u2122 i5-4570 3.20GHz,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 4GB | AMD Radeon R9 290X 4GB @1080p,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,60 GB available space,Recommended:,OS:,Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit,Processor:,3.4 GHz Intel Core i7-4770,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,4GB Nvidia 970, 4GB AMD RX 480,Storage:,52 GB available space,Additional Notes:,* Requires Vulkan,* Nvidia graphics cards require driver version 396.54 (tested),* AMD GPU\\'s require Mesa 18.1.5 or better (tested),* Intel GPU\\'s are not supported at time of release\", \"originalPrice\": \"$59.99\"}, {\"_id\": 601510, \"url\": \"https://store.steampowered.com/app/601510/YuGiOh_Duel_Links/\", \"name\": \"Yu-Gi-Oh!

As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., \\\\u201cAnything goes in this sex andron\\\\u201d; \\\\u201cThat is love, this is commerce. What are you into?\\\\u201d); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door.
